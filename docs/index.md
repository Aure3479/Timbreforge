# TimbreForge / TimbreTouch

TimbreForge makes vocal timbre physically perceivable by mapping **six timbre colours** (Warmth, Velvet, Presence, Edge, Shimmer, Halo) to **six actuator locations** on the arm/hand.

!!! warning "Prototype + audio path"
    Disable noise suppression / AGC / audio “enhancements” on Windows before running.  
    TimbreForge uses **ambient-noise calibration + per-colour noise-floor subtraction**, not aggressive denoising.

## Built on Vibraforge (Huang)
Hardware and firmware are based on Vibraforge. This project contributes the software layer: mapping, calibration, GUI, workflow.
