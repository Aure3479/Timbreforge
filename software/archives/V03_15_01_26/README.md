# V03_15_01_26 — TimbreForge / Vibraforge (WIP)

This folder contains an in-progress version. Notes will be added once the current version stabilizes.

Planned/observed direction:
- NORMAL vs COLOUR modes
- explicit timbre-colour mapping in `voice_colors.py`
- improved Stop/Start reliability (shutdown)
- stronger BLE test tooling (fusion)
